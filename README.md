# LGBTSTEMinar 2020

This is a poster that I presented at the LGBTSTEMinar 2020, a conference for LGBT people in all scientific fields, in Birmingham. It is an overview of the intersection of bioinformatics (clinical computer science) and medical physics in the context of radiotherapy, aimed at an audience of scientists without specialist domain knowledge.
